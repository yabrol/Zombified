This contains 4 projects:
HW1Practice
HW2Jotto
HW3Zomjong
HW5ZombieCrushSaga

Practice was just some exercises to get used to using Netbeans (after relying on Dr. Java as my primary IDE for some odd years).

Jotto is a simple word guessing game. Clicking once on the letter will mark it as green. Clicking twice on the letter will mark it as red. Clicking again will remove highlights. Guess what the mystery word is - kinda like hangman.

Zomjong is Mahjong, but with zombie sprites (taken from Wikipedia's Plants vs Zombies page)*. There are a few options for premade shapes, although more can easily be added.

HW4 consisted of UML diagrams for HW5/6, which was ZombieCrushSaga, hence they are not included in this repository. ZombieCrushSaga is like King's Candy Crush Saga**, but again, with Zombies*.



*PopCap owns Plants vs Zombies, and all related characters.
** King owns Candy Crush Saga, and all related game layouts.

NOTE: These games were made as parodies and I claim no right to the characters and layouts. All work was completed by me, and I relied on Wikia and gameplay to figure out game logic. It is by no means perfect (and due to time constraints, it was unlikely to be such).
